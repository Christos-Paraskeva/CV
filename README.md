The past few months have been both exciting and challenging.  Taking the plunge on something I was curious about, and learning a completely new skill, is something that has been extremely fulfilling.  Coming from a book keeping / admin background, I am using the skills I learnt from that, as well as my passion for technology, to further develop my skills and learn new ones at Makers Academy.  This is just the beginning of my journey, and after extensive research, the decision to join Makers Academy was an easy one, given their focus on methodologies such as Pair-Programming, TDD, Agile and Self-Learning.  I believe this will set me on the correct path to continue my learning in an efficient way afterwards.  I’m hoping to find a company where I can develop these skills further in a supportive environment.



Teamwork

At my previous job at the fashion supplier Lella & Brothers, I was part of a small team where we were responsible for delegating the work between ourselves.  It was important that we communicated with each other and work towards getting the work done as a team.  This role also involved constant contact with our QC (Quality Control) department when dealing with production issues, and our Accounts Department when dealing with payment queries.  I also kept continuous contact with companies such as Tesco, New Look and Primark.  Given the nature of the industry, thing would constantly change.  An example of this is an unexpected variation on the tested composition of the fabric, and it was vital that we quickly worked through these issues with our buyers so that production would not be delayed.



Attention To Detail

During my time as a book keeper, I developed a keen attention to detail.  It was crucial to spot anomalies when dealing with income/expenditure and the subsequent reconciliation, where all the totals needed to match up.  This skill held me in good stead during my time at Lella & Brothers, where I was responsible for generating the payment invoices for Tesco.  Again, it was essential that I cross referenced whether the cost was matching up with the quantity and price of the garments, and to spot any anomalies.  This also applied to the records I was responsible for keeping on all our orders, which involved keeping track on every purchase invoice to calculate the exact cost for manufacturing any particular order.  

Spotting any anomalies was vital for any of these tasks.



Patience

Frequently during my time at Lella & Brothers, there would be an issues with a payment, or a missing payment.  It was up to me to communicate directly with our buyers to resolve the issue.  More often than not, this would also mean being passed around to different departments and a slow process, so it was important to remain patient during times like these whilst working to resolve the problem.
It was also very frequent during bank reconciliation, where the records didn’t quite match up, and it was incredibly difficult to spot where the problem lied.  I have encountered situations like this many times since I began on my journey of learning to code, and this skill of patience is absolutely crucial in keeping the belief that you will overcome the problem.
